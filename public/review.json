The simplicity of this thing is amazing, I have an expensive Windows 10 PC that drives me crazy, I find Windows has become a very intrusive and confusing computer, that bothers you with a load of notifications and pop ups. Trying to figure out how to disable all that stuff is a real pain, Windows seems to bury all those settings, making them hard to find."

I've had this Hp  Chromebook for just a few days, and already I've spent too much time restarting it. On the same day it arrived, it began to freeze and turn off. Repeatedly. I ran powerwash several times. Same issue."

We had been looking for an affordable Chromebook of good quality for watching videos, browsing the internet and using google documents."
